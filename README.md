# homebrew-repo

Repository for my [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) tap.

Note on how to add to this can be found in the official Homebrew docs, [here](https://docs.brew.sh/How-to-Create-and-Maintain-a-Tap).

Install this tap via: `brew tap rikwatson/homebrew-repo`. Then individual formulae can be installed by `brew install foo` or `brew install rikwatson/homebrew-repo` should there be a name conflict with `foo`.

## Formulae

Currenly none, this will change.

Formula [cookbook](https://docs.brew.sh/Formula-Cookbook).

## Some notes on taps

Homebre's own docs on [Taps](https://docs.brew.sh/Taps) & some of their github hosted [notes](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/docs/Taps.md).

Remember this is a `tap`, not a [`cask`](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/blob/master/USAGE.md).

`brew tap rikwatson/repo`, clones this repository to `/usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Taps/rikwatson/homebrew-repo`. (Remember the repository *must* be `rikwatson/homebrew-repo`).

Remove via `brew untap rikwatson/repo`.

```bash
brew tap                     # list tapped repositories
brew tap <tapname>           # add tap
brew untap <tapname>         # remove a tap
```
